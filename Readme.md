# Pong Game.

## Description.

This is my first game finished with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library and *C* language, is cool when you can finish a project, even small project like this. begin is easy but finishe is other thing.

My game has three main windows, all files window are in *scenes* folder, also I will explain every window. the windows are *Menu*, *Board* and *Options*

### Menu

The *Menu*, here there are some options, **start**, **options** (here are all options to configuration) and **exit**. When we pressed the *start* option, will get begun the game, if we pressed *options* we would go to *Options* window, if we pressed *exit* will get finished the game.
